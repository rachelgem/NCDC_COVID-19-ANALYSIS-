## NCDC COVID-19 DATA ANALYSIS


## Introduction
In the wake of the global pandemic, the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) has played a pivotal role in monitoring and managing the impact of COVID-19. We will delve into the total confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, in each state. We're also looking at how much testing has been done. By breaking it down state by state, we aim to uncover patterns and better understand how different areas are coping. Join us in decoding the numbers to get a clearer picture of how COVID-19 is affecting communities across the country.
