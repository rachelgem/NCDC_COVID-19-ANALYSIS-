## NCDC COVID-19 DATA ANALYSIS


## Introduction
In the wake of the global pandemic, the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) has played a pivotal role in monitoring and managing the impact of COVID-19. We will delve into the total confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, in each state. We're also looking at how much testing has been done. By breaking it down state by state, we aim to uncover patterns and better understand how different areas are coping. Join us in decoding the numbers to get a clearer picture of how COVID-19 is affecting communities across the country.

Problem Statement
- What is the distribution of total confirmed COVID-19 cases across different states?
- How do the total COVID-19-related deaths vary across different states?
- What is the overall picture of COVID-19 recoveries in each state?
- How does the total COVID-19 testing effort compare among different states?

## Data Exploration
- I started by examining the general structure of the dataset. How many rows and columns are there? What are the names of the columns, and what type of information do they contain? 
- I checked for missing values in the dataset. How prevalent are missing values, and do they follow any pattern?
- I compare key metrics (confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, testing) between different states. Are there notable differences, and what factors might contribute to these variations?
